# CBT-App 

Cognitive behavioural therapy (or CBT) is a talking therapy to help you manage how you think and behave. A personal diary is one of the methods used to help a patient undergoing CBT. The purpose of a diary is to keep a record of different events or experiences that happen on a daily occurrence. This is used by the therapist to gain a better understanding of how a patient handles certain situations, and for patients to self-reflect on their behavioural patterns. In this modern era, traditional paper diaries can be troublesome due to the potential lack of confidentiality and impracticality of having one on hand at all times.

The aim of this project was to create a user-friendly diary application which patients can discreetly and effectively fill out for professional analysis from the therapist. This will allow the patient to get the most out of their treatment. If the app was not user-friendly, the information provided by the user may be tainted and ruin the whole focus of the process, potentially leaving a patient to feel alienated and misunderstood. The application should allow the patient to enter all aspects of the situation they are inputting into the diary, allowing the therapist to see exactly how the patient was feeling at that time.
